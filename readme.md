# Quora Replica
This repo stores the files related to a replica of [a page](https://www.quora.com/I-have-learned-HTML-and-CSS-What-are-some-simple-sites-I-can-replicate-for-my-practice) under the Quora domain. It's done with vanilla CSS and HTML. I avoided the usage of flexbox and grid, because I wanted to practise display's other values and the position property first. It's my first webpage replica. I also decided to have two css, where the second one is intended to include a light mode colourset. Please enjoy and leave any comments or contributions if you deem it necessary.
